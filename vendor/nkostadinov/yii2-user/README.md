# Installation

1. Download Yii2-user using composer
--------------------------

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist nkostadinov/yii2-user "*"
```

or add

```
"nkostadinov/yii2-user": "*"
```

to the require section of your `composer.json` file.

2. Configure your application
-------------------------

Add following lines to your main configuration file:

```php
'components' => [
    'user' => [
        'class' => 'nkostadinov\user\components\User',
    ],
],
```

```php
'modules' => [
    'user' => [
        'class' => 'nkostadinov\user\Module',
    ],
],
```

Step 3: Update database schema
------------------------------

> **NOTE:** Make sure that you have properly configured **db** application component.

After you downloaded and configured Yii2-user, the last thing you need to do is updating your database schema by
applying the migrations:

```bash
$ php yii migrate/up --migrationPath=@vendor/nkostadinov/yii2-user/migrations
```

# How to run tests

Install codeception globally:

```bash
$ composer global require "codeception/codeception=*" "codeception/specify=*" "codeception/verify=*"
```

Install globally the composer's asset plugin:

```bash
$ composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1.0"
```

Go to nkostadinov/yii2-user directory and run:

```bash
$ composer update
```

Build the codeception actors:

```bash
$ codecept build
```

Create a new database called 'user_test':

```bash
$ mysql -e 'create database user_test;'
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
$ php tests/_app/yii migrate --interactive=0
```

# Advanced user

The yii2-user extension has the following additional functionalities that can be added on demand:

 - [Password aging] (docs/PASSWORD_AGING.md)
 - [Password history policy] (docs/PASSWORD_HISTORY_POLICY.md)
 - [Account locking policy] (docs/ACCOUNT_LOCKING_POLICY.md)
 - [First login policy] (docs/FIRST_LOGIN_POLICY.md)

# Admin panel

You can find the admin panel on /user/admin/index route. In order to set proper permissions, change the access rules of the controller
via the `$adminRules` property of the User component. Defaults to:

```
[
    [
        'allow' => true,
        'roles' => ['@']
    ]
]
```
